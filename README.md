# Alchr's dotfiles

[Spanish version](./README_es.md)

Hi, I'm Alchr. I originally created this repository and documentation for my personal use. I noticed that there is little information available on how to configure Neovim on Windows without relying on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), so I thought it would be useful to share my "default" approach.

I should clarify that I am a beginner in the programming world and am currently learning front-end web development in a self-taught manner. My setup may not be as robust or complete as it could be, but I am confident that I will improve it over time.

I don't mean to be presumptuous, but if anyone finds themselves reading this and finds it useful, I'll be glad to hear about it.

Also, I want to emphasize that I'm not interested in being part of debates about which editor is the "best". Everyone has the freedom to choose the editor that best suits their needs and that choice should be respected. In fact, I tried to configure VSCode to resemble Neovim's workflow. If you are curious, you can take a look at the following [link](https://github.com/alchrdev/vscode_keybindings).

## üõ†Ô∏è Neovim Configuration

### ü™ü Windows

When I started programming I used *Sublime Text* but then I switched to *Visual Studio Code*. However, this editor consumed a lot of resources and slowed down the laptop, which has limited hardware (Intel Celeron with 4GB RAM). Then, I discovered Neovim and was fascinated by its speed and versatility. Although it was hard for me to understand it at first, I gradually adapted and now I don't want to let it go.

- These are some of the people who have guided me on this path:
  - [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez)
  - [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen)
  - [Adib Hanna](https://www.youtube.com/@adibhanna)
  - [Sockthedev](https://www.youtube.com/@sockthedev4904), among others.

So, my configuration could be considered a *Frankenstein* of configurations, as I've compiled the best of each one until I've created something that I understand at a medium level and that perfectly suits my needs.

#### Download and installation of the necessary tools

- Executables
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - [Visual Studio 2015 C++ redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) `https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe`
- **Extractables** (All of these must be added to the PATH _Environment variables_)
  - [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) `nvim-win64.zip`
  - [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/13.0.0) `ripgrep-13.0.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` (All of these must be added to the PATH _Environment Variables_)
  - [Mingw](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/tag/13.1.0-rt_v11-rev1) `x86_64-13.1.0-release-win32-seh-msvcrt-rt_v11-rev1.7z`
  - [Treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/tag/v0.20.8) `tree-sitter-windows-x64.gz`

You can choose the name you want for your folders, here is an example of how I have it:

- In the drive `C` I created a folder `C:\Tools` and inside it the following subfolders:
  - `C:\Tools\mingw\bin`
  - `C:\Tools\nvim\bin`
  - `C:\Tools\ripgrep`
  - `C:\Tools\tree-sitter`

> When you unzip `tree-sitter-windows-x64.gz`, you will find an `.exe` file. I recommend that you create a folder called `tree-sitter` and move the `.exe` file into it. This will make it easier to add the file to the environment variables in later steps.


#### How do I check that they are installed correctly?

- To do this, you can run the following commands:
  - **neovim:** `nvim --version`
  - **ripgrep:** `rg --version`
  - **mingw:** `gcc --version`
  - **tree-sitter:** `tree-sitter --version`

**Q/A:** Why didn't I use a package manager like _Scoop_ or _Chocolatey_? Because I prefer to have more control over the tools I use. Remember to close and restart your terminal if the changes are not applied.

Once you have done this, you can run `nvim` in the terminal. It will automatically create a folder called `nvim-data` in `C:\Usersuario`. In the same location, you will have to create another one called `nvim` and put your configuration inside. You can create them manually or clone one from someone you like or admire with a `git clone https://github.com/nombredeusuario/nvim.lua.git nvim`.

### üêß Linux (Ubuntu)

#### To download the Neovim AppImage from the official GitHub repository, follow these steps:

- Visit [this link](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) and browse for the `nvim.appimage` file.
- Download the file and move it to the `~/.local/bin` folder.
- Make it executable with the command `chmod +x nvim.appimage` and create a symbolic link with `ln -s nvim.appimage nvim`.
- To add it to the `PATH`, edit the `.bashrc` file with the command `nano ~/.bashrc` and add the line `export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH` at the end.
- Save the changes and close the editor.
- Finally, run the `source ~/.bashrc` command to apply the changes.


#### To avoid possible errors with `appimage` in Ubuntu, you can install `libfuse2` with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

- You can also install some additional tools like `ripgrep`, `git`, `nodejs`, `xclip`, `build-essential` and `tree-sitter-cli` with the following commands:

```bash
# Install ripgrep
sudo apt install ripgrep

# Install git
sudo apt-get install git
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

# Install nodejs
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Enable clipboard
sudo apt install xclip

# Install C compiler
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Install tree-sitter-cli
sudo npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
```
